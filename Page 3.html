					<p><font face="helvetica" color="White" style="text-alignment:right;" size="5"> If you would like to download files off the internet, you have to only download from reliable sources. Otherwise you could unknowingly download a virus, and a virus could access your files and damage your computer internally. People can make viruses and upload them onto the internet, disguising them as files that you can download, then when the file is on your computer it will access personal information and the staranger will have that information about you, so don't download anything from unreliable webistes, reliable websites have small green lock icons in on the left of the url.

					<p><font face="helvetica" color="White" style="text-alignment:right;" size="5">When posting things online, you have to be very careful what you post. A tip is to have a private social media account, this way you can control who can see your posts. If you however, have a public account, you have to be wary of who follows you, and be careful what you post, because strangers can see your posts, and if you have to be aware of that. If you are under the age of thirteen, I would recommend you not having social media because you might not be responsible enough yet. Although your parents might think you are responsible enough, and then it is obviously ok.
